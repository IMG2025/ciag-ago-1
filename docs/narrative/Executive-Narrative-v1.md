# Executive Narrative — AI Governance & Compliance Deployment

## 1. The Problem
AI is already embedded in hospitality operations through vendors, workforce systems, analytics, and payments. Most operators did not authorize this deliberately, and few govern it centrally.

## 2. Why Existing Approaches Fail
Governance fails when it begins with opinion instead of evidence.

## 3. Core Insight
AI governance must begin with observable signals, not declared intent.

## 4. The System
Market signals are machine-classified. Humans make decisions. Evidence connects them.

## 5. Defensibility
Every recommendation is evidence-tagged, auditable, and human-approved.

## 6. Governance Triage
A fixed-scope, paid diagnostic that produces a decision-grade governance recommendation.

## 7. Outcomes
Proceed, defer, or decline — all are valid.

## 8. Differentiation
We do not sell AI or tools. We sell governance clarity.

## 9. Fit
Designed for multi-location operators with real AI exposure.

## Remember
AI governance is a control problem, not a technology problem.
