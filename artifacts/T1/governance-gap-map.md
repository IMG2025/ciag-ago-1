# Governance Gap Map
**Engagement Tier:** T1 – Governance Diagnostic  
**Purpose:** Identify structural, authority, and control gaps that materially impair execution.

## Identified Gaps
| Area | Observed State | Required State | Risk Level |
|-----|---------------|----------------|------------|
| Decision Authority | Undefined / Fragmented | Explicit owner | High |
| Control Layer | Absent | Enforced governance | High |
| Execution Ownership | Informal | Named accountable | Medium |

## Material Impact
- Delayed execution
- Unbounded scope
- Accountability diffusion

## Advisory Note
Resolution of high-risk gaps is mandatory prior to system build or automation.
