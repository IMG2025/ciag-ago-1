## Why This Is Tier-1 (Non-Interpretive)
This packet is generated from the Tier-1 export contract. We do **not** restate or modify ICP/scoring/tier logic here.
- Score + confidence are consumed as provided.
- Evidence manifest entry present for operator_key: core-hospitality-operator-002

## Outreach Angle (Operator-safe)
We lead with **governance deployment probability** and **audit-grade readiness**:
- Centralized governance + vendor surface + compliance exposure typically create fast ROI for governance controls.
- We offer an **AI Governance & Compliance Deployment** program with a defined “definition-of-done” and evidence tagging.

## Discovery Prompts (Use verbatim)
1. Where is AI currently used across corporate ops (revenue mgmt, HR, guest comms, fraud, analytics)?
2. Which vendors touch regulated data paths (payments/PCI, HR/PII, guest identity)?
3. Do we have an owned compliance lead, or is it delegated to IT / finance?
4. Any current audit pressure, breach history, or insurer-driven controls?

## CTA (Hard Close)
Propose a 20-minute governance triage:
- Validate vendor surface + AI adoption signals
- Confirm buying center + timeline
- If confirmed, schedule the Exposure Assessment kickoff
